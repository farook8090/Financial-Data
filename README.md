# 🔍 Financial Analysis Using Power BI & DAX

As a Financial Data Analyst, I had the opportunity to deep-dive into a banking dataset focused on credit card usage and customer financial behavior.

Using Power BI and advanced DAX functions, I built a dynamic financial dashboard to calculate key metrics such as:

✅ Running totals of credit card transactions
✅ 4-week moving average of credit limits
✅ MoM% and WoW% transaction growth
✅ Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) ratios
✅ Yearly averages of utilization ratios
✅ Interest earned vs revolving balance
✅ Delinquency rate & churn indicators
✅ Credit risk scoring model
✅ Income vs Credit Limit correlation
✅ High-risk client flags
...and much more!

These insights help assess credit utilization, customer retention, risk profiling, and support strategic decision-making in the banking sector.
